hey how can i report an incident i witnessed on a bus today
quick question i know the low income bus pass timeframe has been extended but what will happen once its over will the time be extended again or no
i know this is a difficult time but the pm 148 schedule needs to be fixed there s random buses added to the schedule such as the 16 25 to chinook that don t show up at all then there s 45 minute gaps in service
route 23 bus 6055
this is the bus i 2019m on right now it 2019s number 1 overfilled when you cut back the number of busses and trains you put both passengers and drivers in danger
thank you a bus every half hour is all i ask cause thats what i thought its supposed to be d83d de02
today i got to the stop at 16 15 previously i d gone out for the 15 56 and it never showed today the 16 31 showed up right on time but there was no 16 25 bus as well when i turned on real time on the app this is what happened
hey how bout you keep trains clean and on time and don 2019t tell us what to do thanks
hay can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
thanks for the change of bus 23 sundridage near canada post as yiur app says us will be here doesn t show now 23 more minutes to wait d83d de1c
i am essentially talking about all bus routes that said i have been frustrated by the 10 the 22 66 13 what was the 73 20 one that goes to mckenzie town centre and more
i have done so many times on multiple occasions i have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min s more than that like every 1 2 hour is not acceptable thank you
pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car
true however more bus drivers more tax payers amp employed people and may also mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads assuming less car drivers
the buses don t always or often coordinate well with each other aside from that why should i spend a life time waiting around when i have a million of other things that i could be doing that would help me get more done in my day
even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary
so for it to be more convenient for you because you can 2019t time bus routes properly you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes good thing you 2019re not in charge
for a 6 30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and i can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus
great job letting homeless people take garbage bag of cans on buses now driver didn t day a word even when three passengers had to move because that bag smelled so aweful
before i answer that is it policy for calgary transit to allow people to bring garbage bags on to buses if theres ever a concern whether its cans that rattle or people s property maybe drivers could do something
calgary transit says it has been busy cleaning inside its buses and c trains
in ednonton transit driver dont allow garbage bags on buses never seen a garbage bag on a bus until this whole ride for free started yeah i m paying but i sure see alot of bums not and getting to ride everywhere
no one said anything in particular to the driver however the old lady that was telling be ayse that guy put his bag in between her and the person with the bag screamed loud enough the driver had to of heard her everyone else did
route 6 time was when i sent you tweet this isn t about myself alerting the driver this needs to be delt with before anyone with a garbage bags gets on a bus thanks
well than it seems your quite alright with bums getting on to buses with stinky garbage bags full of cans i cant think of any other transit system allowing this but you do you dont need any more info if that s your policy take care
thank you for keeping buses and trains going 2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f
thank you for bus drivers and staffs who clean up the bus at night time how can i go to work daily without their help i will keep on buying monthly bus pass please do not stop your services

every single day 39 st is a disaster the train is basically a meth lab on wheels right now morning and afternoon no thanks deal with it

shuttle buses are 24 to 27 feet in length the suggested distancing is 6 feet between two people but the shuttle buses have 10 passengers seating limit in covid 19 please explain so that i feel safe using transit
i do not want to be punished for making the environmentally responsible decision of not driving and taking a bus instead
i just wished as an essential worker we could get a discount on monthly bus passes like the low income don 2019t have to get one until may

i think they are smoking something on the train the number is 2419 we are heading towards marlborough

southbound shawnessy station this morning
i use it every morning to get to work i take route 7 from marda loop downtown today the 6 am bus never came and the ct ap was not working properly ended up taking a cab
it is better for a bus to be 1 or 2 min s late than leave 2 min s early particularly during these times
took a bus today to work frontline chi chi and i 2019m so happy with the way social distancing is being enforced it 2019s a must fightcovid19
there 2019s no way the buses are being regularly sanitized so to be quite honest with you i have not ridden transit in over a month

i think it 2019s a bit more than that i 2019ve been here almost half an hour according to the app a ghost train came through at 9 15 but nothing thanks for checking though
it would be nice for the peace officers to walk through the trains saying hello and actually engaging with passengers
just an observation from using transit daily red line pre covid days
just saw about a dozen calgary transit workers near the ne bus barn walking together without social distancing nice example fellas
why do people have such an interest in all of your drivers it s almost obsessive the way they watch them they may be in a bus together they may live together

serious commendation to the driver of route 119 unit 8014 a lady was late due to the train and he gladly waited the extra couple minutes at saddletowne for her had he not done this she would ve had to take a cab to work awesome driver
i just saw some transit employees walking out of rundle station they didn t have any personal protective equipment it makes me wonder is ct providing staff with ppe gear and amp hand sanitizers now hope so
maybe now is the time to put arrows on the floor by each train door one for in one for out it ll help people social distance now and in the future where people just try to push on anyway
trains are dirty and gross
can i just make a suggestion for the 21 castleridge start time if you could just make it start 3 minutes earlier it would make it possible for people to get the 23 52 street connection at falshire drive station at the moment getting thereintime is a 50 50 chanc

so why is heritage station locked now why is there no signage when you get off the train
you got a group of people prepping to smoke some hard drugs in one of the shelters at chinook station right now
so the station heads are now closed around the clock at those five red line stations when did that start as previously it was 6 pm to 6 am closures
when making this decision was there any consideration taken in to customers needing to take a longer walk to the bus loops and now will be missing already tight connection times due to the cut back of service
do new ctrain drivers have like a simulator they train on or do they get put right into the drivers seat of a train with an instructor
what about from chinook station to city hall station is that closed and from city hall station to max bell station
your driver on route 3 is so rude i 2019m waiting at the stop with a cast and they make me walk 20 meters to the bus after driving right past me d83d de12

let s play do you live in the northeast hmmmm bear spray cans and a guy with clear head trauma maybe a couple of light stab wounds definitely feels like the northeast now let s play is it the rundle station it is it is the rundle station
this makes sense but now there 2019s been lots of people hanging out and yelling at people walking by at the ramp at heritage station i take the bus home now because i 2019m scared of the station more patrolling is needed
is there a shuttle bus to fish creek station
city closes five ctrain station buildings as covid 19 changes life in calgary yyctransit ctriders
jftr just follow the rules the time check stops have been carefully considered and mapped out it s not up to the drivers to make random time checks wherever they want people count on the bus waiting at a designated spot
85yearsagotoday in yyc toronto consultants wilson amp bunnell recommend that the calgary municipal railway now convert from streetcars to trolley coaches or buses conversion takes place 1946 201350 after the greatdepression amp wwii image via
is may bus pass available yet
the calgary transit planning group have demonstrated significant incompetence and require an audit and overhaul we have areas with extremely low ridership that have large noisy polluting buses every 20 min and areas with high ridership running buses beyond capacity
i doubt there 2019s going to be more panhandles that are coughing on people at that station
train 2243 has some epic vomit on the mid train
blue line is down monday as well
i purchased a low income bus pass at the end of march for may that option was available but it was never mailed to me so i still use my march bus pass for may or should i have received the may one

upper deck of brentwood station 2 guys so high they might fall down
why are shuttles going to the opposite sides of train stations then where the signs for shuttles are posted
franklin station signs are posted only on the northbound side with shuttles only on the southbound
are buses free right now i didn t have to pay today because you guys aren t providing transfers
why have a time when the bus comes its never at that time as well you think if it says it s going to leave a train station it would leave on time not 5 mins before its says it will depart i should stop paying because i usually have to get an uber anyway
the driver of bus 8012 just passed stop 8711 where there was a person waiting despite the fact that the person was standing up and was clearly visible from the road
i 2019ve been waiting for the bus 5 minutes before its schedule and when i looked in the app again the schedule was changed it left 10 minutes early don 2019t they have to follow the schedule i 2019m sory to say this but calgary transit has wasted a lot of my time
i was at the stop around 2 30 waiting for the 2 38 one but when i checked again it said the bus already left at 2 29
here 2019s another problem i couldn 2019t check where the bus was on the gps because the schedule can change but the gps doesn 2019t seem to cooperate sometimes
the first time i checked was around 2 27 and it said the bus would be there in 7 minutes so i went to the stop then time passed and it hadn 2019t come so i checked again at 2 37
no i decided to take the train instead
wtf i m currently in a train car where 43 other people are on driver kept letting people on wth

but my shuttle driver asked me to deposit my already ripped ticket in the box i have nothing to show on my next connection if prompted
the shelter and bench at stop 9267 could use a good power washing
thanks and to be clear not complaining about the driver just confused as to the current process
i see thanks and there is also no logs or timestamps of actual arrival and departures of buses that i can get the info i need
i have an appointment for my dog 2019s check up tomorrow and im just wondering if small dogs are still allowed in the train and bus
car 2409 southbound train a guy in a hockey mask has scissors in his hand gripped like a weapon hes not yet threatening anyonem
how do passengers show the bus driver their bus pass or put a bus ticket into a box as payment for the ride if passengers are boarding the bus from the backdoor and not supposed to walk up to the driver

i don 2019t like to rat anyone out but the driver of the route 13 using bus 7940 has no idea where they are going
there is a detour on 8 street sw where there is a water main break south of 17th ave and myself and another passenger had to direct the driver through the detour and then back on the main route to 14 street
it 2019s not a big deal i know these are trying times for everyone but a little better route preparation for your drivers would be good i expected that from a weekend shuttle driver not a weekday newflyer driver
i 2019ve been in 3 buses today and none of them would let me use the front just the back with the back is hard to get up and my stroller didn 2019t fit threw the isle they just watched me struggle so maybe ask bus drivers to be letting stroller threw the front for the ramp all 42 bus
not sure if it is calgary transit or city ploice but there is a man passed out up on the over pass right by southland station
bus 3 at nb 4 st sw 25 av sw didn t stop probably didnt see me it stopped at the traffic light i went there and knocked the door and he saw me and didnt open the door now i have to wait 20 minutes

while i am grateful for it is discomforting to observe social profiling in the downtown core at the last stop before the free fare ends peace officers are asking people who look homeless to vacate the train before asking for proof of payment askforpayment
hey here s an idea that can help make taking transit busses a cleaner safer experience during covid_19 retrofitting existing bus bell buttons for elbow forearm operation more info listed in pictures below
please ensure bus drivers are told to open back doors and not expect passengers to do so it s too hard for those with mobility issues as backdoors won t stay open unless drivers do so
on many occasions i have had to asked drivers to open the doors during these covid 19 times so i don t have to touch the bars or strips they are able to open them when entering the bus it should be easy to do the same when a person is exiting
i was on a train that was checked this morning as well and they checked everyone and if someone didn 2019t have a pass they were asked to jump off and buy one not sure how they target the homeless when they ask everyone
there are currently men doing maintenance at whitehorn station on the north bound side there s no notification of any delay or detours or if the train will be going on one side only please let me know what s going on
my son was waiting for the 408 at brentwood station turned his head for a moment and the bus left without even stopping for more than 30 seconds i know there are very few riders but now he had to wait because the driver could barely come to a stop before leaving
are we still using the march bus passes for this month
mind telling me why the bus was over 5 mins early to my stop forcing me to watch it drive past without anyway to catch it the app even stated it wasn t supposed to be there for 3 more minutes please hold your driver s accountable madigan and minora dr ne
guess why your not making any money as the bus drivers aren t asking for you pass or fees so most are riding for free
a big yeehaw to every city worker every driver every doctor nurse first responder and on and on for keeping this city rocking i stay home because i want every one of them to reunite with their loved ones soon
your bus driver on route 81 4 digit number 1298 4 40 pm almost pushed me off the road when changing lines he did not care that i was right beside him had to brake really hard and if there would have been a vehicle behind me it would have hit me
hay can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
route 21 has been late to my stop everyday this week and i haven t been able to make it to my connection on time at falshire drive station please please tell the drivers to start being punctual because the minutes matter

last two enclosed structures on the train platform in the south direction it 2019s hard to miss and they have littered everywhere inside the structure they are the only ones currently in the enclosure
is the something going on that s new bus driver was just so rude kicking people off buses with out fare people had money ready but he said i cant take money than threw a hole bunch of people off
i ve seen transit riders pick up since last week the buses and also c trains are more packed now then i have seen in the last 2 months
eb new brighton gate 52nd st se bus stop the garbage can is overflowing there are dog poop bags and garbage laying all over the sidewalk around it time to empty
bus stop 265 super gross definetly urine and questionable materials on the ground
amazing i pay 111 for a bus pass and the last two months have been nothing but horrid experiences one after another between the homeless just polluting our transit bus drivers who clearly care less about their job than most and edmonton showing calgaru how it should be done
i agree service should be reduced however i don t think it should be cancelled some folks don t have cars amp can t afford a taxi ride to the grocery store and to the covid 19 test sites how are they suppose to get where they need to go if the bus isn t running in there area
what is the point of making people with low incomes buy a pass s when no bus is is able to take them to from the grocery store due to the route being canceled
first announces that low income folks have to buy the bus pass then they cut some routes that serve them it makes no sense to me don t they know people in poverty live in all city quadrants
you are taking a complaint because the driver wouldnt let them ride free so your siding with the free riding passengers during to taking a complaint against the driver so everyone can ride free
sorry route 38 just south of the whitehorn l station south bound on 36 st ne
are bus passes still available to purchase i ve just realized i am probably returning to work next week and dont have one

oh like that one time a crackhead threatened to kill me as i was waiting for the train at chinook lol
i need to catch the 3 by 9am going to heritage so should i just walk to victoria park for the c train given the above
he did not call the metheads he said addicts which is reality we can have compassion but this does not mean we have to watch it and be fearful from being at a station our stations should be a drug alcohol free zone where we feel safe
if the restaurants and stores are closed along the bus routes are closed where can the bus drivers wash their hands use the toilet the bus driver yesterday needed to go but could find an open washroom on route till he got to a gas station
these should be located at the bus terminals too train is often last not first stop on a multi leg trip
hey a guy on bus 5 8262 is about to smoke crack on the bus black hat bald sitting at the back of the bus also not social distancing from others

please pull the footage from the bus and use it to educate your driver s on what not to do i abife by the rules of the road he completely forced me into the curb had all the time in the world to go behind me or do around this will involve charges as this is not ok
back when i was still commuting to from work a bus would turn in front of me almost every single day on 9th ave and 6th st se heading west i ve been honked at by busses for being on the road i guess more times than i can count over by stampede sorry this happened to you
wouldnt you need a bus or rt any bus could be driving there

i moved recently and i want to purchase my june low income bus pass but it will go to my previous address how do i change my address
just want to point out it 2019s pretty inconvenient when you keep reducing times and services yet the province announced stuff is gradually opening so morons are out here crowding trains and buses causing us to wait for different trains or buses that aren 2019t packed
wish you cared about the employees that drive those buses everyday the way you seem to care about social distancing at a park

your basing future ridership during a pandemic on current ridership amp making adjustments weeks later so when buses become overcrowded based on ridership after relaunch of stage 1 you ll take another few weeks to ramp up service placing riders nurse here at higher risk

the driver of the 7 i got on made me and another passenger get on the front of the bus we were both waiting for the back doors to open they didn 2019t so approached the drivers door to ask them to open it 1 2
i caught the bus at the corner of 14th st and 17th ave it was around 3 30 i 2019m not sure about the exact time the clock was not flashing on the bus
this is a great idea it would be nice to see some history incorporated in station designs from art to stations themselves
why do we need to give single ride ticket if the drivers wouldn 2019t give transfer pass so if we need to ride more than 1 bus we need to give 2 tickets which will cost 7

ok i 2019ll see if other driver will accept that thanks
morning why is there so many empty buses moving along 24st se between 114 ave and deer foot trail this starts at 4am and continues all day if the cycle time for the run is every 30 mins then the drivers must be leaving each stop early route 92 96 150
would be nice if my bus drivers and the cleaning staff were wearing them wearing them properly
i was on the bus monday and i was the only one that showed my bus pass and everyone got on and off the bus without showing anything so how is this working by the honour system i bought a pass for june by why if none is showing payment
the westbound 153 bus reached stop 9616 at 7 43 today and i was told earlier this week that it was due at 7 50 please tell your drivers that being early may mean up to an additional 30 minute wait for passengers it has happened to me earlier this week

well when your on a bus your not exactly performing a tracheostomy risk of a high viral load is unlikely unless your on 1 wearing a cotton mask will suffice in protection from asymptomatic carriers who get too close sneeze spit eat or have poor hygenic behaviour on board
ps your point was you stated masks arent necessary trap germs amp contribute to litter read your 1st post again wrong on all counts necessary distancing is not always attainable on a bus 2 hold germs no they minimize exposure to such 3 litter cotton washables aren t tossed
what s going on with route 99 yesterday and today it was 10 min late i m at stop 4243
hey i m at bus stop 2488 why did the 99 bus stop here is there a detour
i came here to say just this this spammy campaign is very hypocritical when i take the bus i wear a mask toprotect the driver and my fellow passengers to bad the drivers don 2019t reciprocate guess passengers really don 2019t matter
you tell us to wear masks but not your driver s
yes and i make sure to get to the stop early as the route runs every 45 min

i didn 2019t notice the number i left the train at 4 03pm at centre st station
try 2 out of 31 people wearing masks the other morning on my train car amp i was 1 of the 2 you can not safely distance with 31 people on a car either
why are you removing the 201cdo not sit here 201d stickers on the bus seats it 2019s hard to respect the 2 m distancing when more and more people are starting to use transit again and things are getting crowded if anything more signage is needed to enforce it not less
where the hell is your route 10 stop 7380 i 2019ve been waiting at the stop since 7 05 supposed to show up at 7 14 no show

i did not know that thank you for telling me i have arthritis amp was carrying a grocery buggy getting into the bus required some unusual athleticism on my part i think you should put some signs up to let people know
there are signs about it on the bus window right by the front door if you are trying to board at the back it is easy to miss them though
is the red line running from sunnyside to chinook
ok thanks i was looking on the transit app and map app but they were showing i 2019d have to take a bus once i got to 6 st sw
we only got coins to pay to bus driver is that ok
we also need transfers from bus driver
the chinook heritage c train replacement bus i am on id 6008 may have actually been soiled with human faeces but the smell is bad enough that nobody seems to want to actively look for it someone has notified the driver but i think it needs to be inspected
will it be mandatory to wear a mask to ride on your buses and trains
ok wait so what if i had to transit to the other side of the city that required 3 different buses i 2019d have to pay 3x rather than once because you aren 2019t giving out transfers
why aren 2019t any trains going from southland to downtown they 2019re all heritage all day
you guys are terrible this city in general does not care about social distancing l is down amp makes everyone take the bus you guys suck boycottyyctransit
hey is bus 4 gon na be at stop 8045 soon been waiting here for about 45 minutes now
100 un organized having heritage doors closed so you have to walk from red line bus and have train leave as people are at the cross now waiting for a new train that is not here yet and making it so i miss my connection why do i pay for such poor service
is there a way to back pay for the month of may i couldn t buy a bus pass nor bus tickets because a lot of things were closed and i feel terrible
grocery stores and convenience stores don t sell the low income bus pass for people on aish and people on ab works who don t get paid till june 1 the only way to get it is to buy ticket so you can buy the bus pass at the places listed on the website
hey guys what time are the trains running till now
is ctrain travel free at this time
any chance you could look into the 29 35e route schedules i literally have to walk half an hour to get to the nearest train station because otherwise it 2019s a 45 minute wait on weekends they both come within a minute of each other
appreciate some attention is being made however person on train saturday afternoon sprayed cloth once with whatever solution was in bottle amp proceeded to wipe all poles straps in entire car no added spray added at anytime similar to wiping every table with 1 dirty cloth
best part is they got on at like city hall station with that thing they must have carried it from the river lol
every american city burning calgary 2 dudes fighting with an air mattress on a train lt 3
was not intending to make an issue of it so do not have train car number i got on at 4th street station blue train going to 69th st approx 2 to 2 15 pm guy wore a florescent vest that said bee clean he was already on train car and he got off within next few stations
if it is any help the train was the second newest model not the red side seats but the gray ones the drivers door leads out to the door loading entry not the bench seats for 4
i m on a low income open up so i can buy my bus pass id rather pay 37bucks then paying 3 30 every single time
how does that work c train pulls up to let people off and buses immediately leave no one in their right mind can run fast enough to catch it lateforwork hesawusrunning 57 whodoesthescheduling
arrived at whitehorn station at 5 46am myself and two other passengers we ran for it but barely made it off the platform to see the 57 leave
i just saw the bus driver didn 2019t stop for a lady running for to the third to the last stop 402 silverado i am in the car but i check our stop it was supposed to be 8 55 for our stop because i take the bus too but my mom drove me and it was way too early

south health campus 14 bus
ticket machine 603 at sunnyside station isn t working the touchscreen is black and it won t come on
south health campus 14 bus
i don 2019t even bother with anymore because they just tell me it 2019s my fault for using the app for being at the busy stop early but not early enough for running after the bus that was early we 2019re in the middle of a trying time but none of these issues are new
not an incident and not as dramatic as i make it out to be when i 2019m frustrated and getting soaked i was at a bus stop several minutes early and waiting when i saw the app counter flip from 6 to 4 to 3 to 0 the 42 and i 2019m in an uber now
65 market mall stop at charleswood amp brentwood mall the app said 6 minutes
i know what the issue is the app doesn 2019t match the bus 2019s progress i know it can 2019t be perfect but it should be close when the only option is a bus that runs every 40 minutes in this case 42
that means nothing i have seen one driver wearing a mask this whole time if you aren 2019t going to practice what you preach stop preaching the hypocrisy is unacceptable
i am officially back to work tomorrow i just realized i didn t buy a bus pass or tickets how do i pay in the morning
this was route 3 going through dt a little after 6 pm 6th ave and east of 2 st sw when i caught up to bus because he blew past two stops early attached pic is the stop where i got off he made sure to hit the breaks hard so i slammed into the door partitions

i ve met recently amp separately w acting head of and acting gm transportation re ctrain safety and i can assure you imo calgary and best practice has not moved on developing

gentleman at city hall station laying going to somerser on bench and it appears he 2019s vomiting and ill can someone please check on him easy indian wearing a blue turban has a medium to heavy beard
this is the first time i was asked to tear my bus ticket but since i was already heading home that i forgot to ask if they are giving transfer or such since these bus drivers are asking to rip my ticket
low floor buses do not seem to be used at the moment
i haven t seen your driver s wear them so tell them to as well or kindly shut the fuck up about it
seriously massive layoffs and route cuts then as ridership increases busses and trains will be suddenly overcrowded who came up with this stupid plan
how about increasing the number of buses on your more popular routes so people can adhere to physical distancing rules
how do i ride transit i don 2019t get it i went to your site and it said please pay but i have to get on the back of the bus apparently and go to front to pay and get a transfer but they don 2019t give transfers please advise
don 2019t i have to show my ripped ticket to the driver
again i can 2019t pay by cash i don 2019t get a transfer i have to get on the back of the bus to go to the front to show i have a ticket and then tear it
is the 43 running today waited at stop 4557 since 5 19 am and it was supposed to show up 5 31 am never came
i am not happy with the bus driver who just went by stop number 2844 at 723am just now i have been waiting here for 15mins for them to pull up and just as i stand up from the seat they pulled away the driver didnt even give me a chance to get out of the shelter
fyi looks like some of your buses are not sanitized this was at 6 40am today anderson station bus 92
what is policy on carrying refundable recycled material on the bus i was told for the amount i was carrying i could be refused access to the bus

so had to get off small bus 1331 route 147 no 201cno sitting 201d signs on any seat and the driver stopped at a stop that 2019s had 10 more people getting on so i had to get off to be safe now i have to walk the 15 stops to 39 ave train station thanks
like 10 minutes ago at the stop on 42 ave se outside the casino
are any trains running in the core 10 mins waiting at 1st street station and nothing either way
hi there stop 5122 waiting for bus 6 your app says 50 minutes wait is this correct
are trains being affected by the protests downtown
surely a ctrain first bizarro
how long the redline train to tuscany coming to brentwood
dont believe the 2 bus schedule has changed its always had this 1 particular time in the morning schedule that has an exscessive lag btwn coaches
is there any word on when we ll be needing to get new monthly bus passes as the city reopens
there is a young man requesting to use co riders phones to call the police now he is spitting on the floor of the train 2335 second coach just headed towards bridgeland from city hall
are passengers supposed to be 201cflashing 201d our tickets or passes to drivers when we get on the buses now i have no issues paying some drivers just say no but others are adimant i show my pass confused
thank you to the driver who personally dropped off my friend s senior mom s lost wallet tonight kind and much appreciated yyc
seeing this post again after 4 days have you determined the protocol for method of disinfecting being done my concern for your recollection was in regards to using same cloth without added sanitizer to smear any possible contamination throughout train is this standard
so im confused tou app says no 444 for 50 mins but ur website says there is one at 7 07 stop 3571 i looked at the app 6 56 am
i mean if we 2019re working 5 days a week it 2019s more expensive to buy the tickets this month hurt though i have to walk 2 2km to the train on weekends after a full shift on my feet because it 2019s faster than waiting 45 minutes for both buses that show up outside my work
is there a reason why the driver on the 302 was only asking black people for proof of payment i wasn t asked and the next white people after that black woman got on were not asked seems like a discriminatory policy
sb train is stopped at anderson no announcement from the operator what has us delayed yyc
i am waiting at stop 8974 for a route 20 northmount it was supposed to arrive at 8 47 someone else waiting at the stop said it went by early now i am going to be late for my appointment

hi you guys should put more trains on the blue line as there 2019s no physical distancing due to the trains being over crowded and put some decals on the seats and the walls of the trains just like you guys have on buses 201cno sitting 201d
you re supposed to rip one of your bus tickets in half or have a bus pass or have a valid ticket from a train station machine

i m currently at victoria park stampede station waiting awhile what s going on now
i m currently on the train i don t know why it s standing at victoria park stampede station while ago
hi if i order online my low income bus pass how many days does it take to deliver
what s with the sat bus service the driver either shows up super late or not at all and doesn t even know the route leaving stranded passengers this has been going on now for the last four saturdays in a row i m about to lose my job over being late from it
i am extremely disappointed in one of my employees wanted to ride the bus this morning because it is raining quite hard she waited in sherwood for bus 129 at 9 30am it arrived she got on the bus and had coins
rout 43 going from dover to chinook station it s supposed to arrive at 923 pm but never does as they are late or don t even show up its getting to be past frustrating when my job is now on the line
i m lucky if the driver shows by 930 but i m still late for work and they seem to forget about the bus circle by the glenmore inn so those passengers now wait even longer
then the driver informed her coins are not accepted only tickets he kicked her off the bus in the rain is this the best we can do where is our humanity the bus had two people on it
i was at ch superstore yesterday no more cleaning carts barely a cleaning station for diy when you get in they weren 2019t even keeping track of numbers when i arrived by the time i 2019d figured out the cart situation there was a line up but inside was busier than it has been
hey what is the policy with bus passes for june i was just told i may not be allowed to use the low income march bus pass
hi are you excepting coins for fares on buses i can not find the info on the website or in your social feed thank you
so does that mean if i am getting on a bus to go the the ctrain but only have coin that they will let me on free of charge till i can purchase at the train station
bus 29 is supposedly showing up to stop 6061 25 minutes late it was supposed to show up at 1 45 and according to another rider who 2019s tracking the bus it 2019s just sitting there it 2019s getting pretty ridiculous to have to wait an hour just to get a bus home
someone forgot their keys in the blue line train to saddletown around 3
okay can you stop train at mcknight while i go ahead to talk to driver
i gave it to 8224 21 bus number
is there an issue with the max yellow woodpark two buses have passed by the sb heritage park station not using the transit way and have been on 14th street
there is a smashed bus shelter right infront of abbeydale school
i heard rumours that people can t buy the low income bus pass at city hall is that true if it is how come it s listed as one of the open locations to buy the pass on your website
is the bus route 10 city hall coming to the stop nb fairmont drive 78 ave se at the times shown on website
thank you hope the stop is not affected by the road closure at intersection of 4 av and 1 street sw
so no more fare violation tickets why even bother asking for tickets what s the rationale for asking them to get off the train more stigma amp humiliation
route 120 is scheduled to stop at nb silvergrove and silver springs rise at 7 50 why is the next real time bus say 8 30
i phoned at 7 23 and it told me the next bus was in 27 minutes i make that 7 50 past experience tells me it reaches that stop at 7 43 i 2019ve missed the bus twice and had to wait gt 30 minutes
why does it say 10 40 when 20 mins ago it said it was coming at 10 07 this is bus 78 5830 going to somerset station
no bus eh
is there a 55 bus stopping at stop 6258 at 11 34 the time just disappeared off of the app for me and only shows the bus after that at 11 50ish
so i teletexted for a time on a stop 7 02 am i thght id gotten the stop wrong but nope i justgot a text 4 5 hrs later
car 2439 northbound just pulling into 39th avenue station
it wasnt late your app just said that there was no 11 34 bus i caught it fine but your app said there wasnt a bus coming at that time
thanks was at the main north point station stop not sure the number at 2 45 bus i m on is 6002 bus that i could be on was 6045
ctrain 2412 the overhead compartment has popped open by door 2 in the standing area
going north on the red line i m off so it s probably at crowfoot by now or tuscany
can people get mask when they buy their low income bus pass now the reason i m asking is because according to this website it s available to transit users now in both and
homeless shelters and women shelters are for people who don t have a permanent address people who don t have an permanent address can t get the adult and seniors low income bus pass
i hope that includes the driver i couldn t understand why she was stopping to let more people on when every available seat was taken
if the mask is already on property customer service staff should be ready to hand it out to the riders when they buy their bus passes and tickets in addition to that cta drivers should hand it out to their riders too
couldn t see the bus number this was route 1 at 4 50 coming into inglewood from downtown
has the schedule changed for bus 402 silverado it was every half hour the bus came at 5 15 and just left right away normally would leave at 5 30 i 2019m still waiting for another bus to come
i 2019m at somerset station sorry i didn 2019t mention that
people with mobility disabilities can t enter and exit the back door they enter and exit the front door since it s the only one that has a ramp what is being done to protect both the passenger and the driver in this case
how come ct bus drivers aren t given a mask when they need to step out of their vehicles to go use a public washroom i saw the driver for 1 bowness bus ask someone at tim hortons today ask if he can use the toilet i felt bad when the th staff said no mask no service
what time does the next 454 comes at stop no 3782 the app says another 45 mins and i have been waiting over a half hour already
kudos you have a driver who 2019s gone above amp beyond the call aaand in life right now d83d dc4cthat 2019s really a w e s o m e at ogden road amp 78th avenue se bus number 43 from canyonmeadowsrealcanadiansuperstore called the bus 302 wait d83d dc4c d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f d83c df1f 2b50 fe0f thanks very much d83d de4f
bus 6003 kudos also 21 23 dropped off 2nd st amp 6 avenue waiting time for bus route 6 i can 2019t tell you enough how much i adore calgary transit this evening d83c df1f d83e dd70 d83c df1f d83e dd70 d83c df1f breath of fresh air especially been guaranteeing way too long d83d de4f d83d dc4f d83d dc4f d83d dc4f d83d dc4f ur awesome
it looks like someone knocked over the stop for the 43 eb 58 ave se burbank rd the drivers don 2019t always stop now can we get it replaced pleaee
pretty blatant crack smoking in the shelter at chinook station
hello the buses 147 are small busses and they are leaving people standing on the bus stops because they can t take more people maybe could be a better idea to have the regular busses running in this area
your driver making me feel like i am breaking the law because i dont have a pass asking where i am going its none of his business i have tickets and have paid daily since this all has started
just got on the 44 bus 1258 i get hes doing his job but asking me where i am going is wrong if transit wants to enforce payment have someone at each station asking
wish they did that more often i have sometimes asked bus drivers to do this and they have told me they could not donna you got lucky
any chance someone could actually help me here i ordered a bus pass online through the fair entry program i received a youth pass i asked to exchange and you expect me to go all the way downtown to get another this was not my mistake all i want is an exchange
maybe it would be good to prioritize who gets it based on who s at highest risk of not being able to heal from getting covid 19 disabled riders on calgary transit access riders who get the low income bus pass seniors who get the seniors and low income seniors pass
middle machine at eb 6th street sw station thank you
loving the live entertainment on the train today yyc
now that things are reopening and people are going to be back to work will the times for busses and trains be closer to normal during rush hours
when will u guys be allowing 4 car trains and back to regular service
4 car trains hopefully not until the load justifies them d83d dc7b
oh really we can buy it online what happens when they send you the wrong bus pass you get told too bad our mistake go downtown during a pandemic when you can barely afford the pass in the first place fair entry uh huh
the poors have to get them on the bus somehow is getting a shipment
people in calgary who have a higher income than those who get the low income bus pass can afford to do things like buy groceries drive a car thru mcdonalds tim hortons or a amp w to get the mask has provided buy hand sanitzer and lysol wipes pay rent on time
when people can afford to eat healthy food get a mask buy disinfectant and hand sanitizers as well as soap and pay rent on time they have a better chance of being able to heal from covid 19 people who get the low income bus pass can t afford those things without help
on one hand i agree with you there needs to be more people on board to justify the cost of running the 4 car c train but on the other hand having 4 car trains now would help with physical distancing especially during rush hour
that photo was taken at 5pm previously it would have been standing room only a couple stations after this i don 2019t take the train too often in the morning but the last couple times there were seats available all the way from somerset to city hall with some standing
the 7 09am route 20 never showed up at heritage station are there delays on the route this morning
bus shelter smashed to pieces in lynwood 5857
delays on the ctrain today
hello did route 167 break down somewhere because i have been waiting for it at the bus stop number 2201 since 3 20
i have a 2019 youth bus ticket is it still valid
there are a number of passengers who are not disabled enough to require using the front door of the buses during current driver accommodation but have difficulty in boarding and exiting via the backdoor b c drivers don 2019t care to pull in close enough to the curb
please have some no smoking announcements at city hall station thanks
are you installing plexiglass safety shields on all your buses or is that only for shuttle buses
i have a question about the 301 bus heading to north point country village rd amp and harvest blvd is it still running after 6 am my maps have been saying differently
d83e dd23 i 2019m sorry so the 301 bus would be running at normal time sorry for all the questions
oops sorry i would catch the 301 bus at north point around 7 am in the morning is my plan if that helps
north bound red line just stopped on the track north of chinook fun times yyc

yesterday about 3 30 saddletown train
my bus this morning 32 is pretty much full what is the procedure for having too many people on the bus it 2019s not a double long bus either just wondering or can you shed some light staysafe
thanks for the survey i have completed fyi thus far this week i have experienced guy drinking beer on train and 3 men with bikes on the train sitting together in cordoned off sections all during rush hour really would be nice if there was more security
when there is a detour on route signs would be nice is my stop closed or not i don t know the app is unclear where do i go to catch my bus no idea i m late for work again d83d de2d d83d de2d d83d de2d
he got on at centre street station

is 32 late at rundle station it as supposed to arrive 9 minutes ago d83d de14
the train arrival boards are displaying times temporarily not available at somerset station
i was on the bus and train yesterday and half of the people are not wearing mask i don 2019t know why they find it so difficult to wear mask which protect everyone
if the busses are running every 33 minutes now could you try to keep the app up to date with what time the bus is actually coming i missed 2 busses today because they both came and left more than 5 minutes early d83d de43
it s a simple duty amp responsibility for transit users to wear masks who s gon na drive the bus if the drivers get ill or dies it s also a show of respect otherwise we should employ shame that often works take it from a post wwii boomer
four people 2019s taking drug at heritage lrt station

can you buy your fare ticket at the train station from the machines
anderson station smoking on the platform
with less capacity per bus due to social distancing you need to run more or larger buses on busy routes such as the northbound 43 in the afternoon rush watching multiple buses with no capacity go by is very frustrating
hi is something going on with the 22 lately i usually catch the 4 25pm toward city centre at stop 8651 on wed it was 15 minutes late today the app says it will be 15 minutes late again also any news on going back to full schedules thank you
thank you bus arrived 17 min late but it would be nice to know whether i should expect this to keep happening every day thanks for your help

wondering if the victoria station platform overhaul project is still in the works last i heard construction was to start after stampede 2020
are you going to be increasing the frequency of 302 friday was first day of phase 2 and it was full with blocking off of seats there is no room for new passengers and 30 min wait between buses
you need to train your bus drivers how to read a clock i showed up 10 mins early for the supposed time for the bus and it already come and gone thanks a lot you have now made me late for work
not in the station but in the shelter on the platform across the bus loop sorry the right agency needs to work with these people and help them
holy not sure what s up with train car 2251 redline today but that is one godawful noise alarm malfunctioning air not sure but its loud
can you tell me how often 65 runs on weekends the app says the next bus is 55 minutes away that can not possibly be right
1 i know i complain a lot and may be written off as a crank and i 2019m sorry but like tens of thousands of calgarians i absolutely depend on ct the price of my bus pass keeps going up and the service i 2019m paying for keeps going down that 2019s insane
3 it is simply wrong for the coty and ct to ask calgarians to drive less and take the bus if there is no bus or adequate bus service when we pay for a ticket or bus pass we want to ride a bus not be taken for a ride or thrown under the bus
maybe if we could get free uber when we show a valid bus pass
can you imagine being at an unprotected bus stop rn yyc yyccc
so its raining heavily at southland station and the driver of route 126 unit 1220 left the station 2 5 mins ahead of schedule with five people running towards him
these two windows are leaking on bus 8340 route 42 they are at the front of the bus drivers side nearest the back doors

hi been waiting for the 61 bus to saddletown station and its supposed to be here at 613 but its already 622 i ll be late in my volunteer job i ve been in the bus stop since 602

what 2019s happening at marlborough station

are riders still entering the buses thru the rear doors when getting on
why don 2019t you get marlborough train station cleaned up garbage everywhere what looks like blood on the floor in spots like it 2019s getting worse by the day yyc

i think the outside elevator at brentwood station needs service i just went to use it and on the upper level it stopped and opened the doors but was at least 5 inches below the floor then it moved with the door open
drug deal happening right now 39ave train station foil is out and they are ready to get high i never see the transit police here there 2019s always a deal going on or people getting high or high and passing out at this station
why don 2019t all the buses have bike racks at least the ones on major routes like the 1
how do you perpose we should keep distance on blue line when there is always 16 mins or late always service of blue line and people take risk because next train isn t behind it s 16 mins after work on your schedule please
that s not concern where i catch the bus on blue line i am talking about keeping distance in blue line when there is lot of passanger waiting due to train running every 16 mins if you going to keep 16 mins service than add 4th car on lrt so we can keep a distance
had an issue with the route 32 huntington driver bus 8251 the driver refused to open the front doors to let my husband on with a stroller then refused to let anyone else on if there were no available seats a passenger was nice enough to get off so my husband
it was at deerfoot city at approximately 4 30 there was a fair number of people at the stop who he wouldn 2019t let on as well the route 32 is now running every 40 minutes during peak times
hey ct the train i was just on was pretty pack so was the train i took home last night all seats were taking and standing well with in 2 meters of each other what s your plans going forward
yes i ve read it it says nothing about when a train is packed again i ll ask are you just allowing over crowding on ctrain then
there s a syringe on the platform at downtown west kerby station south side by the ramp
isnt that what happens i thought there were only so many passengers allowed on the buses so a person got off so another got on what is the complaint
is there a plan to make masks mandatory on buses and trains i am hesitant to consider using calgary transit if majority of passengers are without masks and without physical distancing measures
is there any trials in the works for replacements for the ergonomically terrible seats on the mask trains can i make a request to have this looked in to
female smoking weed upstairs rundle station
where can i get a shuttle bus to the nw from 7th st

the driver of route 120 on bus 1213 demanded a rider 2019s ticket and instead of a transfer said to write down the bus number and have a peace officer call him if she got stopped 1 2
if i get a train ticket online do i need to print it off or do i just show it on my phone
hey i left a purdys bag on the 10 going towards city hall i didn t catch the number but it would have departed about 6 15 from chinook station
did my bus at chinook station just straight up dive away waiting on 10 southcentre only to have the bus with its sign switch to out of service and drive past us seriously this is the second time i two weeks
darn must ve been really early or perhaps didn t make the turn to go to the stop
thanks so much it has my bus pass in it though any chance of getting it back tonight kinda need my pass for tomorrow
yyccc well done passing greenlineyyc thank you next steps 1 build it asap 2 put bike racks on every bus and we will have a great transit system
why can t i have a parrot on a leash on a train
that a passenger got on so the guy with the stroller could get on but the driver still tried to drive away without them also you are supposed to be allowed to board at the front with strollers and mobility devices
as a parent i can 2019t stress this enough ctriders while trains and buses can be exciting to our youngest passengers always remember to hold their hands inside the stations and on the platforms
is there anyway that you can have an articulated bus on the route 32 sunridge that leaves the 78th ave terminal at 730 by the time it hits centre st amp 64th ave it s packed
there is an abandoned blue suitcase on the dalhousie station platform there is note on the handle
there is a passenger fast asleep on the red line heading south car 2249 just a heads up
very welcome need to keep the train clean and safe

on cart 2436 somerset bound at centre st man passed out cold on train

as someone who just moved in wolf willow and has to take transit daily i would sincerely appreciate if the 444 ran more often so that i dont have to trek up and down the hill which adds 30 45 mins to my trips to the closest 78 bus stop
the piece commissioned by features eight colourful steel horses cavorting across downtown 2019s harley hotchkiss park a familiar calgary landmark along the c train line yycarts
since many cta clients don t normally go to ctrain stations amp since some of them can only purchase their bus pass via ct estore i m wondering will your cta drivers be giving the mask to cta riders hope so many of them are in the high risk category
wow just wow the 113 driver didn 2019t stop she literally just looked at me and my sis waving at her running to the bus stop 7216 wtf we are only few steps away at the bus stop at 2 09pm
i wan na go on a bus in calgary just to hear this
the arms are also not going up by bridlewood station either
no you assumed that i wanted a free handout not everyone is selfish and only thinks of themselves there is a 78 year old neighbour of mine can 2019t drive takes the bus within the neighbourhood to get her groceries how about her doesn 2019t she count i made and gave
your drivers should never be aloud to refuse service to someone with a bike in the pouring rain especially when the bus is literally empty bus stop 8419 route 301 north 10 00pm i am cold wet i just want to go home driver opened his door and closed it on me
another driver just drove off with my bike seriously what the hell is going on today
nope i mean none of this would 2019ve happened if your driver let me take my bike on the empty 301 i tried to get on at 10 00
also like had they lived up to what they promised years back there d have been a bike rack on that first bus so you wouldn t have even had to be chastised by a driver
your driver just called the cops on me because i 2019m trying to go home
transit driver just called the cops on me because of this like what
seriously why do they even care about people taking stuff on an empty bus at all let alone so much to cause a problem and feel they have some moral superiority
thank you for the reply i am moving to cochrane this summe and currently drive transit bus in vancouver
hi good morning i 2019m taking the train from saddletowne that left around 6 15am it 2019s packed full people are sitting beside each other i don 2019t know how we are going to practice social distancing if you could please look into it
hey there you guys need to do better with safety on route 23 there are people standing because the bus is so packed and the driver just keeps letting more people on
five employees one bus not social distancing and none of them wearing a mask boy that s embarrassing
good move well done i was wondering how you were going to protect drivers from passengers with disabilities and visa versa when the passengers need to use the front door to enter and exit the bus safely
i don t understand this whenever i jump on a bus the attendants are never taking tickets telling me to hang on to them as they don t give transfers
they are back to checking on the train i 2019ve had to show my pass a couple of times this month
then why are there no signs on the train and the train i was on june 18th at 1913 at 39th avenue was packed and most not wearing masks not safe at all and very concerning to me that they 2019re are not safeguards in place
the ctrain arms at heritage are broken
i got a notification that replied to my tweet earlier today and it has suspiciously disappeared doesn t change the fact that i was on route 24 this morning and there were five transit employees not wearing masks on one bus set a better example please
a segment of the chain on the barrier to prevent l passengers at lions park station from jay walking across 14th avenue nw has been removed broken for a while very dangerous
your turn i only see 20 to 30 wearing them not even the bus drivers and definitely no men how can you police this though
train 2207 has no station announcements and no signs outside the train telling which line it is everything is blank on all cars redline going south at sunnyside
kudos to the driver of the 444 bus 1841 for hanging out at the station for an extra couple mins because he did that i was able to make the bus i normally miss going home departs somerset at 3 22 153 doesnt get in until 3 24
i hope that the do include disabled people and seniors throughout the entire design and construction process for the greenline so right from the start all of the stations and bus stops along the route would be 100 accessible
bus driver on bus 6044 listening to very angry men yelling in a foreign language recordings while driving the bus not very comfortable on the max purple right now asked him to turn down was ignored he needs to turn that off
i m wondering why the route 46 is 38 minutes late
hi are you guys starting to take fares passes now my 16 y o sister was yelled at by your 38 driver today stating that she needs to show proof of fair or leave sense when was this ok she had fare but the verbal attack is not required
how do we even pay on the bus last time i used one the driver got me to use the rear door and i didn t see where to pay i ended up paying at the c train station
not quite sure the stop but it is by annie foote school 38 brentwood 8pm tonight can you clarify if this is required she was able to board via the back but was required to still show proof just want to be prepared for next time so she doesn 2019t get put on the spot
might want to tell drivers of your community shuttles small buses they re asking for fares to be put in the fare box which is great and all unless the passenger is continuing on with another bus train twice this past week i saw people upset when they could not get a transfer
can we re pass this info along the buses aren 2019t adhering to the lowered speed
hey can you explain why my bus just drove past my stop with me frantically waving my arms as he kept going past me route 78 at stop 8248 can you ask him to kindly stop next time i ll be here still waiting
it was route 78 at stop 8248 it just happened and no i was not just approaching the stop i had been standing at the stop for 6 minutes prior i watched him not slow down waved my arms as he approached he had no way of not seeing me trying to get his attention
can the next bus pleas stop i am trying to get somewhere
there is zero signage regarding station closure at the at grade entrance at southland station only sign of train disruption is at the building entrance the closed building entrance
good afternoon i am just wondering and requesting if some of the articulated buses could move from victoria park garage over to the spring gardens garage to enhance the social distancing
yes somewhat i have to kill some time today before work and was wondering if i caught the 92 at anderson all the way to the end of the route then catch it on it 2019s way back to anderson and get off at the stop at my work would i stay on the same bus or switch at mckenzie
can you tell me when the next tuscany train is arriving at chinook station screens are not showing the times
did you get on the bus eventually how long did it take for the next bus to show up
that 2019s fine but why not communicate it better i had to find out when my bus driver told me i can 2019t get on today
those shower curtains are a hazard for drivers on my bus the curtain kept sliding and the driver kept moving it and almost side swiped someone this can 2019t be safe
thanks for adding extra buses then normal for this disruption it made the journey a lot less squishy and more comfortable d83d dc4d d83d dc4d
on max yellow city center this is the third time we have stopped to 201csit 201c waiting by old greyhound station now bus 8297 5 53 ridiculous
i tried using my mru one but it wasn 2019t allowed thankfully my driver wasn 2019t an asshole so i got on
1214 has no sign probably an 11 could you ask the driver to poke the sign
hello calgary transit don t mean to harrass you but the barrier to prevent passengers disembarking from westbound l at lions park station from jaywalking on 14th ave nw side is still missing very dangerous
hey transit peeps could you let me know when the last redline train from downtown westbound is tonight
went and bought some tickets instead of a pass the driver on the first shuttle had me put the ticket in the box but didn t get a transfer just said to tell the next driver to say that i paid on his route don t want to pay again if the next driver doesn t believe me
hi there are some personal items left in bus stop no 4331
could you tell me what time is the tuscany train coming at sunnyside station
you guys should really shut the train time signs off some say 102 minutes
i ve never seen no one on the trains or buses cleaning them
it s too far for some to go for tourist it be really nice if the ride goes from the hotel to a ctrain station by making that happen it would also encourage cta to pick up drop off clients there since they go where ct has a fixed route service
ordered it about a week ago i know it takes 5 10 business days but what can i do before the ticket book comes if most bus drivers get made if i try and offer cash payment
there is a lot of broken bottle pieces scattered on the lower floor if the whitehorn station a piece ran right through my sneakers might pose a problem to those wearing slippers please attend right away have a great monday

the sommerset train now at earlton station had a guy just leave a crapload of garbage on the train he got off at the bmo station
some people are not respecting social distance on the train i have been in the situation where other people just sit down beside me that i 2019ve been force to change sits or stand up
i do it to avoid the dogs on the train that you allow because i 2019m allergic
there needs to be seating instructions for the trains people sit beside you without a care in the world because no signs or instructions are posted on trains
maybe one for buses leaving the station when people are standing in front of the door as well transit is getting worse day by day its quite sad to see what we pay for get worse and worse
please start by being leaders and have all bus drivera and employees wearing masks i wear one for them i would like to see them wear one for me a paying customer

bus 53 brentwood just drove past me 2 minutes early waved him down and kept going at stop 6792 bowness and home rd
the stop number is 6564 i 2019m from vancouver and the buses there go every 15 25 min at least i think that should be implemented here as the buses are passing here every 45min
it 2019d be nice to have more efficiency as for the buses itself they are not well maintained i definitely think they need an update bc is doing a good job on this but i think calgary can do better
on the route 43 and the bus driver decides to take a break at tim s for 10 mins i go in and confront him and says will leave in 5 mins i have to work i dont want to wait for the bus driver to get coffee twice
one of your trains last night would not open the doors at university and when i tried to get the ddivers attention he didn t care
please stop you can t seriously think that fucking with the same c train line multiple weekends in a row is a good idea
it was about 915pm on the red line going to tuscany the train car was number 2425
could you advise when the buses will require pass to board
the bus number is 8294

tha you for clearing that up then however how come i was denied access to the bus going to the train station even though i had clearly shown the driver my coins for a transfer do only some take the honour system how can i be sure the next trip i take i won 2019t be denied again
i would like to be updated on the situation to ensure for myself and other passangers about this situation i hope actions are taken i was not even given a warning i hadn 2019t even stepped inside the bus yet it is bus 15 stop 4753 beside the church at 10 50am

i noticed today that the lions park l station s protective barrier on 14 ave nw has been repaired thanks calgary transit and calgary 311 i d like to respectfully suggest to increase the height of that barrier to make it an effective deterrent to dangerous jay walking
is it normal for a bus to kick its passengers off in the middle of the route with zero explanation saying the other bus was just outside but it 2019s been 8 minutes amp we are still waiting or
it was the number 3 northbound and it dropped us off about 10 mins ago on 40th ave and centre street he just stopped at the stop and said he 2019s out of service but the other bus was outside we got off and there was no bus and he drove away

hello are you guys still doing rear boarding if so how does it work will the bus driver just open the rear doors once they pull up to your stop
yes they are and yes the driver will open the rear door hope that helps
you may want to talk to your driver of bus 14 7758 6 10am to somerset station the bus has more than 7 people standing and he is still letting people on d83e dd2c he s nice and safe up front but what about all of us
sign of the times parking lot maybe 20 cars two of us waiting for a bus and no busses in the loop
so the buses cleaned often at least every night is it just a coincidence that i took the 93 home from work last night and noticed 2 zip ties tied together on the floor of the bus near the bench seats by the back door and they 2019re still there today
love showing up to my stop 5 mins before the bus is scheduled to come not seeing a bus walking over and it being ten minutes past it s normal time guess bus stop times are totally made up now
welcome to calgary transit where the buses are decrepit and the times don t matter
yeah i super love just waiting around all the time because buses can just show up whenever they want what a joke of a service
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sitting here since 1 42 so that bus went by what 1 38 i can see the stop from my work didn t see any bus going by what a joooooke d83e dd21 d83e dd21
i remember selina having to uber when it was really cold because the bus just didn t stop for her
i honestly can not stand that especially when they pass stops early though shouldn t be a thing i left work early to try to miss the rain and now i don t have a connecting bus when i get off
aaaah i see things are back to normal running for the train doors close as you are there try and open they close and off the train goes
will trains be back to 4 cars also
thanks i will have to wait till august to use it as i had already purchased a bus pass for july
do your operators understand this at all i just had the driver of rt 9 bus 8333 tell me to scan my ticket on the reader to pay my fare i double checked after getting to my destination there is nothing for me to scan if the operators are misinforming people things are
i think the fares are kept in a e ticket wallet i don t know if you could just screenshot it to share it my fear is a dead battery waiting for the train or bus and your battery dies free charging at terminals or pass is linked to phone number yyc yyctransit
hi so i tried to get on the 126 and the driver had left the stop before i got there so i ran to the other side cause he was going around the circks and waved to him he looked me dead in the eye and shook his head no and kept going i m very upset
stop number 6097 it was for the 4 08 pm bus that just passed
why is there no mention of riders without smartphones despite a lengthy faq section also 90 minutes is insufficient time to complete many trips across the city especially with the current decreased bus frequency
i hope for the sake of accessibility and safety the low bus pass can be purchased on this app soon actionhall nocontact mask
can we buy low income bus passes with this
people on aish get paid on the first of each month if they had this app they could stop buying a bus ticket to go get their low income bus pass on the 1st they can get their bus pass while they re at home nofareevasion
could you please open anderson station it s honestly annoying walking around the entire station we haven t even had it open for a full year since it s been renovated this is rediculous sincerely someone tired of leaving 15 minutes early unnecessarily thnx
i buy low income bus passes i can buy them online and have them sent to me on the calgary transit store but i do agree this would be alot more useful
when are ctrain buildings being reopened
must be a problem with the timing board at erlton has said 11 min until next tuscany train for last 5 min
i take the number 5 bus everyday and there isn 2019t enough buses that come every 15 20 min as it should be bc has a bus often pass by can this happen here in calgary please
only 10 percent of passengers wearing masks on my train ride home yesterday lots of people on the train too very scary
i was the only one wearing a mask on my bus yesterday this included the driver who was front door boarding had no mask and there was no barrier between him and us social distancing wasn 2019t being followed either this is why taking transit is a last resort
please consider to add more trains trains are really crowded now hard to keep social distance from other fellow passengers
almost nobody is wearing a mask for anyone today out of 20 people on my bus only me and one other person wore masks
train i just got off at was packed no where to either sit or stand and properly social distance why is this allowed
i just had the exact same issue trains was packed no where to sit or stand and properly social distance
we re sharing a busy bus or train car for others it reduces the risk they ll get infected by me about 70 for me it reduces the risk to me of getting infected by exhaled droplets by about 30
there are about nearly 30 people no sitting 1 standing on route 1 bus 6047 going to forest lawn at inglewood now
trying to get home from work and wasn t let on the bus because three other people pushed ahead when the driver told us how many people could get on i was the only person wearing a mask pretty angry about this run more buses at this time this is completely unfair
your phone app said max o would be westbound 16th ave amp edmonton tr at 4 08 i arrived there at 4 02 amp waited until 4 28 last thurs i also arrived 4 minutes early same stop for max o it came 10 minutes late but then sat 4 min at centre st why app inaccurate

when your bus blows past the stop early it is super disappointing with reduced service the train times and bus times are entirely out of sync
i don t have the information needed to report it it was route 78 i don t know the stop number as i have now left that area to take a different bus it was about three minutes early and while that s not a lot it s enough for someone getting off the train to miss it

please tell me this is an error 43 minutes for the next tuscany bound train
bus has not come to this stop yet i was here at 4 25
bus arrived at 4 43
here s a question about collecting fares do any of u think about installing a temporary fare box in the middle of the bus maybe on the middle seat
can you advise if the trains will stay at the same peak rate as we are now entering the summer period or will they go back to pre covid peaks of 3 5 mins in rush hour as this will help with the distancing too
how are you preventing someone just taking a screenshot of the qr code and sharing it is it unique every time the app is opened if not then this looks very easily manipulated if its a only used once in a time period then how will folks go from bus to train ect
if i board a train with 10 minutes left on my ticket can i complete my 30 minute journey as i m already on the train or do i need to purchase another ticket to cover the additional time
i was on the c train yesterday morning yes they are giving out masks but people are not putting them on there is no physical distancing whatsoever i didn 2019t see a single transit employee come on to sanitize at any of the stops i am very disappointed
so y 2019all are all down for a second wave too nice good thing im still avoiding buses like the plague
i have to say i 2019m lucky i 2019m wearing a face mask with the amount of people coughing in the ctrain d83d de21
i 2019m not sure why route 92 is called mckenzie towne route when it drives all through the backwoods of douglasdale and even further more loops to douglasglen 40 45min bus ride taking the 92 mckenzie towne route to andersen station is ridiculous should be 20 max
bus 8034 driver isnot meant for customer service he almost didn 2019t pick me up despite me waving at him then someone pushedfora stop and he drives over two stops until we ask him to stop he proceeded to yell at us telling us to stop tellinghim how to do his job

hi no more free rides on buses thanks
makes zero sense people getting more sick now they decide to make transfer touching people bus drivers could infect 100 if not 1000
the bclean bus cleaners are not properly clesning the busses they use dirty rags and little to no cleaner they are just spreading the virus they need to be properly trained
they never came then one of the 3 pulled out bolt cutters and tried to steal a bike pointed it out to my shuttle bus driver nothing done unbelievable
will we be getting transfers if we have paper tickets then and if not how will we transfer to a different bus train
so is it going to be madiitory to wear a mask on the buses at this as some people due to breathing issues can not wear masks
so will it be mandatory to now wear masks on the bus and trains as some people have breathing issues and if so can a driver refuse that person from getting on the bus
you might have me to remind the people at the train station to wear gloves when handing out i saw one of the people the other day holding the masks without gloves on i said no thanks as i don 2019t no were those hands are clean or not
everyone else on the train and those they will be in contact with
two guys here on train bothering everyone saddletown ctrain last car train going towards bridgeland memorial station
but mr peace officer sir i activated my ticket before entering the fare paid zone i can t help it if my mobile data doesn t work inside sunalta station

is the 502 running today if so when does it depart heritage station
two of ten passengers on the 3 bus 8036 have a mask oh and the driver has his curtain open useless protection covid19
wow all the buses i was on were empty thanks for finally kicking all the homeless people off after 3 months are peace officers finally giving out tickets as well so the ctrains are some much more safer and cleaner
did you know that they have been promoting the my fare app like crazy for today and yet not available in ios app store people who bought digital bus pass are being forced to pay for daily fare
i was at the stop around 9 45
any news on when the myfare app will be on the apple store some of us need to use the bus tomorrow and would like to check out the app before we get tickets and reprimands from the peace officers
what do i do for a fare i didn 2019t buy a pass for july as i was going to use the ios app now i have to take the bus
is there a delay on the redline displays are saying 28 min for a tuscany train at brentwood
how am i supposed to get on the bus when the app isn 2019t available and i don 2019t have time to go to the store and get tickets ridiculous honestly
this morning i had to take the bus just wondering if everything is back to normal now front of the bus boarding giving out transfers no screens lack of distancing on the bus and no masks but same signage about covid19 rules has something changed
the masks was more about having close contact with the driver while paying fare entering from front of bus and the driver has had endless contact with people in a day and wasnt wearing one nor using the screen its as much about their safety as ct riders
the only thing that doesn t clarify is the drivers this morning our driver wasn t wearing a mask screen left open mask aside they have the most frequent contact with riders and are high risk themselves and to the riders for catching cov19 esp when passing out transfers
can we still pay with regular bus tickets i plan to wait to see how this all rolls out i asked this same question yesterday but didnt get a response trying again
not really wtf the fact that i have to run to an atm if i need to take a bus could pay atm fees and then get a 20 that i need change for nah they needed this on the bus ages ago this will help a lot of people
can we still board at the back of the bus and rip our tickets or everyone boards at the front again
explain to me why your drivers are allowed to be verbally abusive and then twist it onto customers i was struggling to find change and as i tried to pay on my way off as i had to spend the trip finding not enough change your driver called me a dumb cunt
this is why it should have been launched mid month imagine thinking you could download the app and buy your monthly pass then you find out someone dropped the ball and now you have to scramble for bus fare and then find somewhere that has a paper pass it off to a good start
why most people using transit these days are retail workers and our hours are still the same today all this will do is make it even more difficult to practice social distancing on ctrains and buses
is canada day free to ride the c train
heritage station the stairs up to the pedestrian bridge over the tracks lately people hang out at the bottom of the stairs making it difficult to navigate
your own advertising at train stations say the app is available on the app store website also says it 2019s available there too d83d de1e
where do you find your drivers driver of bus 22 number 8067 is a pure shit driver are they allowed to speed if your drivers hate their job they should quit what a asshole
bus route 22 seriously needs better drivers they don 2019t seem to comprehend their routes what a joke our transit is
you guys should really get a system to tell people how long the next train will be the last 3 times i ve used the ctrain i ve been met with times temporarily unavailable just sloppy really calgary is a great city we re better than this it s the small things
at brentwood station going towards tuscany
got the my fare bus pass activated but not scanning i know it s just new but have someone look at it please thanks by the way it is convenient no need to go to a store to buy the pass
i have it thru android bought the monthly pass activated but not scanning when i board bus d83d de0a d83d de0a d83d de0a
true sorry are just words to calgary transit if you were truekt sorry the way customers are treated would be completely different allowing 3 months of homeless people to destroy buses and ctrains not make app promises and when finally start charging have regular bus scheulde
bus was never free pay your fare and stfu
so i got yelled at for trying to pay my fare on the bus so i didn t bring any change the next time and i got yelled at for not paying what is it do we pay to get on the bus or not
bus is the 19 8346 this time passengers were let on from the front it is just a really mixed message and i don t know what the hell to do when i get on a bus anymore
i can scan my myfare pass on any other buses but bus number 10 why is that how can i fix that because it s so annoying and embarrassing
printed tickets do have an expiration they effectively expire when there is a ticket price increase there is a loop hole for printed tickets if you have cash for the fare increase the printed ticket plus coins can be deposited into bus fare box and a transfer receipt issued
bus route 23 it 2019s now a small shuttle it 2019s impossible to follow social distancing please check on that
how long will it take for my bus pass to be mailed to me i purchased it june 26 and it 2019s july 2 now
almost every time when looking for extra coins boarding bus w older paper ticket after annual price increase kind transit driver says oh don t bother with it just put ticket in with old price it s fine even if the coin is in my hand already i put it in regardless
how come people are getting on and off at the front of the bus again unsafe the drivers plastic curtain isnt even pulled all the way to protect the driver
i went into the office a day last week for the first time since this started and the c train felt like the least safe part of the experience by a wide margin d83e dd14
i wonder is transsubc trainstation the act of using a promise that you re heading to buy a pass as a form of bus fare
so i asked a driver why they were letting people through the front door they were very nice they said it was because is losing money on people not paying fairs what a shock at least this driver was actually using the plastic screen
they havent taken all of the signs off of all the buses yet that will be removed
just used my fare for the first time showed it to the scanner and it said just used even though i just activated it had to show the driver i just activated it for him to let me on
just tried again on different bus it said regular show id for about 3 seconds then went away driver told me to try again and it said just used again it s a youth single ticket that i purchased yesterday and activated at 2pm why is it doing this
are passengers still able to pay a cash fare on buses
i usually buy a low income bus pass i just ordered one online so how do a take transit until the pass comes in
ones again the bus 147 to the 39ave station 4 20 pm isn t stopping and leaving people on the bus stops because they have 10 people already on the bus maybe is a good time to get a large bus or maybe you should stop and let the people get on if we are wearing a mark
on the heading downtown i m the only one on this bus wearing a goddamn mask and i m so disappointed yyc
hi i understand that if you pay for a ticket with myfareapp and take the ctrain peace officers can demand to see the ticket on your phone that opens a pretty huge can of worms what rules are in place to prevent officers from going through your phone
um should the 14 going into bridlewood have a driver because right now we re just sitting at the station with no one
this good reading on ticket issue same as we ve seen pay extra don t fun 1 that if you use them per the driver you will get fined just reading thread should give some insight how confused customer is with mixed messaging from various transit reps
when we don 2019t help the poor and the elderly people by reducing in person contact we may be making the spread of covid 19 worse include their low income and seniors bus passes on the app please
calgary transit never answered question nor updated faqs on privacy found this seems they are tracking location senses if you ll miss your bus tracking real time should be disclosed on faq before people download it where data is stored users etc
your drivers need to be protected better since drivers do step off their bus during their time breaks and when someone needs help boarding the vehicles please give them a mask to wear that way the public will be encouraged to wear the mask ct gives properly
drivers deserve to have the mask they need while they are at a bus stop or standing on the ctrain platform not just while they are inside the vehicles
driver of bus 124 enroute towards north point at 9 20pm please fix your headlamps which you were flashing for no reason and follow traffic rules where there is construction without honking you blinded small car drivers like me and honked at us for no reason
damn good thing so many of your bus drivers are so kind amp polite because my grocery buggy tipped over amp the oranges made a bid for freedom le sigh she took in stride wish i got her name but i was socialdistanacing
or got to ride the bus for free more likely you should be complaining on apples page really they the ones to blame and they always pull shifty stuff
no it 2019s the developer and transit they dropped the ball the taxpayers paid a ton of money to get the app and they failed riding the bus isn 2019t free you are still expected to pay if you can 2019t get the app
that 2019s the way it 2019s supposed to work you used a youth ticket so the driver knows to check that you 2019re really a youth and you can 2019t scan your ticket on the same bus so quickly after the first
welcome to the 21st century now if we could move away from individual ridiculously overpriced monthly pass to a simpler 201cload x onto my account tap to get on train bus deduct x from acct for that ride 201d system like many major cities i 2019d be impressed not so much right now
human shit in the bus shelter
if you ve ever taken the train at 6am you have witnessed a first nations person fall asleep i ve even done it on their way to work and the cops transit cops too wake them up and harass them given the question originally posed what protections will citizens have
i m just glad i can order tickets and or a bus pass online
i activated my monthly pass at myfare when i rode the bus just right now and when i scanned it it said 201cshow regular id 201d the bus driver didn 2019t know what it meant either
hallelujah no longer is change and or a piece of paper a requirement to board a transit bus in calgary kudos to having had card tap payment options at l stations for years now thx
i accidentally forgot a lash kit on the 15 fish creek at shawnessey at 9 15am could you contact the driver and get him to bring it to lost and found i really need it thank you in advance
haha why do guys care if you bought a single ticket at the train station it would expire in 2 hours if you want a book buy a book lol
i dont think you know how the apps work if you just said that and only believe that riding the bus isn t free no but if someone showed up already paid for their apple ticket and it was broken you can t believe the bus driver made those riders get off the bus
thats what i was thinking but the show id thing was only on the screen for such a short amount of time that the driver cant even see what it says before it goes away
bus route 146 at 12 25 just drove past my girlfriend and 3 others waiting at the bus stop can you explain why now everyone has to wait 30 min for the next bus to come
bus route 145 in skyview at 12 25 just drove past my girlfriend and 3 others without stopping can you explain why this is now everyone has to wait 30 min for next bus
it would show a yellow light as opposed to a green light for a normal pass if the driver sees the light they should know
when the bus has already been sitting for a while and is then running late i have a problem with it i fully understand that drivers are entitled to breaks i pay for the bus to run on time though
again today it seems that because i m using a youth ticket that i have to show my id but the scanner flashes red when it says show id making the driver think it s declined and they make me try again which makes it say just used train your driver s please
there is a light post at westbrook station that is open exposed to the elements south head entrance
do all the buses accept this now
when are y 2019all gon na put apple pay or tap interac in them buses
buying a ticket for a bus or train with apple pay yes app is based off of thanks yyctransit
i almost bought one 2014not to actually ride the bus but just to see if it works
so far it 2019s pretty straight forward in terms for the train just makes it easier to buy things on the way to the station and then activate curious how it will work on the bus
why are your bus drivers trying to make us throw out a validated ticket to give us a transfer isn t the point to reduce contact points
on june 15th 1987 i moved to calgary from sask to find work i was given 2 weeks by the relatives i was staying with amp on the last day of looking a driver tipped me to a job at today was my 1st day of work 33 years ago amp made me an albertans
real professional attitude for drivers to complain they hate driving the route they are on with a full bus load route 42 that left marlborough station just before 6pm couldn t get bus number due to my vision
they were talking with another driver while at the station other driver was from the 43 both were complaining about driving routes in marlborough and dealing with people therein which felt insulting to a resident of that area
it would be the stop at intersection 52st ne and skyview ranch landing ne not sure what the stop number is unfortunately
hey at your 6th street station you have a light hanging down
yeah 7 days is super short i have a pack of bus tickets from like 10 years ago they 2019ll still accept them
just used my fare app for the first time i have questions about ticket bundles and low income bus passes in hopes to make the app accessible for all calgarians so i will be sure to provide my feedback ctriders
just wondering if the elevator at marlbourgh station is up and running now
hey just wanted to report that someone hass pooped inside the bus shelter the stop number is 7532 your office is closed so i could not call it in maybe stay open later
been back to work since may 14th haven t seen one 4 car train on the l hard to social distance on 3 crowded cars
probably should consider ysing a pic of someone boarding the bus with a mask 2026 at least for a few months
can we please have a bus that goes to market mall prior to 11 am i arrived at brentwood station at 10 15 and the next bus available is at 10 45 minimum i have to be at work by 10 45 i thought being at the station 30mins before my shift would be enough time
hey there is a person underneath the seats on the middle train cart on train number 2401 heading to summerset not sure if the person is sleeping or passed out
i 2019m not sure if they require medical attention i noticed when i was getting off the train at city hall
why can t you guys also digitize the low income bus pass would be nice to not have to wait for them to arrive in the mail just thought i would give my 2 cents
if i have a monthly pass new my fare pass do i scan it every time when i get on a bus or just show it to driver
