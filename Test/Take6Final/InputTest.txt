Crazy guy at kipling station #ttc @TTCnotices @TTChelps,
Someone passed out chillin on the bus platform at kennedy station #TTC http:\/\/t.co\/bsj7Ufd45L,
Kid passed out on the bus, drooling on himself #ttc,
Hey @TTCnotices @bradTTC there is a fire at the Greenwood TTC yards. http:\/\/t.co\/VK56aLqIZn,
#Ttc #Ttchelps there is a man lying on the ground (dead or sleeping?)by bus platform 86Scarborough at Kennedy station,
Thank god for noise cancelling headphones cause there is a child on this bus that is practicing his parakeet impression #TTC,
There is a dude with a damn crossbow on the train. #TTC #Toronto,
Just saw a woman taking a photo of two guys with thick uni brows on the bus... Stay classy TTC riders @RuderidersGTA #ttcing,
just saw a woman of at least 22 tell our #TTC driver she isn't paying a fair because she's only a kid. He said \OK\" and let her on free WTF?",
Just saw a disturbed dude toss trash into the subway train. I get inside, some geezer is chugging 2 cans of Molson. @ttc you need cameras.,
just saw a bunch of security guards run towards the TTC station at stc, never saw a fat guy run so fast,
Someone on the bus is coughing. Better not open my mouth and breathe and dont touch what she touched! #Toronto #ttc,
This boy sat beside me on the TTC bus and he smelled so bad, I started coughing and I think he noticed. Then I had to leave my seat.,
My ttc bus driver on the 116 is driving with his left leg propped up on the seat, I think he is bored out of his skull,
So the bus I'm on just hit a car and now I'm stranded. TTC you get better everyday, I swear.,
Looks like everyone is taking today off. The bus I'm on is practically empty. Loving it! #ttc #morningcommute,
#TTC now the bus I'm on is short turning and throne behind is ashore turn as well great system,
The TTC bus I'm on smells like a baby's soiled diaper #ttcproblems #whatsthatsmell,
Some disgusting human being keeps spitting on the floor of the TTC bus I'm on. #ttcetiquette #severelylacking,
The subway train I'm on is boiling hot. Why does the #TTC have the heat blasting when it's almost April?!,
Over 30min later, still waiting for my bus at Kipling. I despise the #TTC so passionately days. Not like I need to be anywhere... @ttchelps,
my bus driver literally just pulled over to smoke a cigarette i hate the ttc,
Annndd my bus just blew past my stop. This day is shaping up well. #TTC,
Warden station smells like Captain Black cigars and cat pee right now... #TTC,
The guy driving bus 7788 on the king line right now deserves a gold star. Good #ttc morning!,
My metropass just fell between the cracks of the seat and wall of a #TTC train... im kinda having a major freakout right now. Lifeline GONE,



The rush hour crowd amuses me. Why does everyone stick to the front of the train when there is lots of room the rest of the train. #ttc,
#shittiestservice FYI ttc is not helpful to put trains out of service after saying there is a delay at next station #cattle #terrible,
There is no train service at Wilson Staion due to a Toronto Fire Investigation. Trains are turning back at Wilson Stn. #TTC,
RT @JonSinden: There is a direct correlation between how poor the TTC service is on my bus route and how good I'm getting at Tetris.,
RT @coopcabs: #TTC ALERT: there is no subway service between Bloor &amp;York Mills Sat\/Sun. Upgrades being made. Shuttle Bus in effect. #Toronto,
RT @mikamidolo: Remember there is going to be construction on the platform at #TTC Union stn May 2&amp;3. Trains will not stop or depart from U\u2026,
If there is another shutdown of all 4 subway lines then we know there will be no shuttle buses. What a contingency plan, TTC. #TTCfail,
RT @am640: Line 1 service at Finch disrupted due to power outage. Shuttle buses in operation #TTC,
RT @Douglas680NEWS: When a shuttle bus arrives at Sheppard Stn it's a mad rush to get out of the fierce wind on Yonge St. #TTC @680News htt\u2026,
When the TTC bus comes don't walk... just Run!!\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3,
Best part of my day was being on the new #ttc buses. They're so cray.,
Food smells have got to piss off bus drivers. #ttc,
Glad to see the articulated buses on the Sheppard Shuttle bus routes. Still busy though.\n#TTC http:\/\/t.co\/okmKJ0sVWq,
TTC really needs to smarten up , bout you're gonna have a white lady on the bus cussin out all the black people , yelling out the n word,
So.. Is my bus coming any time soon or nah ? #TTC,
I wait 20 freaking mins for a bus to come, and then two come literally piggybacking one another. I mean COME ON. #ttc #ttcproblems,
Today's #TTC adventure involved 5 buses, 1 subway ride, 1 streetcar ride, 1 shooting at Finch station and a fire... http:\/\/t.co\/TaXJtKrwdd,
Too little, too late #AndyByford, #totallydisgusting: TTC spends $1M so far this year on bus driver surplus: report\n http:\/\/t.co\/QuyfAyn0O1,
What's will all the 401, TTC and GO bus issues this Friday morning?  Weather is good, dry. WTH?,
Best #ttc driver ever. I wish I could share this bus ride with the city.,
Bus driver is so nice ! #TTC,
For #ttc passengers westbound on line 2, service slow.  Took 45 mins for a train from VP station to Broadview station. @TTCHelps @CP24,
All the TTC trains smell like B.O. cause everyone is sweating in their leather jackets cause of the nice weather #TOWeatherProbs,
RT @norm: REMINDER: No train service on the Scarborough RT this weekend. Buses will be stopping at all stations. #TTC #TOpoli http:\/\/t.co\/a\u2026,
RT @sj_196: You know you're Canadian when everyone on the train stands up as soon as an elderly couple walks in #ttc #Toronto #Canadians,
Bad #TTC day. Long gaps between street cars this a m. Long wait for train. Bus driver looks other to avoid stopping.,
How many stops will this train make for personelle changes. Kind of defeats the purpose of taking the ttc if you can walk faster. @TTChelps,
Why does the TTC post how many minutes until the next bus when the bus doesnt even show up?,
RT @TheTorontoSun: So the #TTC removed this sign at Downsview station this morning. Wonder why? #RideTheRocket #topoli http:\/\/t.co\/YtxjoxHv\u2026,
#TTC can't understand why a train full of people has to be offloaded, then have them try to fit in the next train that's already crammed?,
@Ttc why is it that your bus drivers are so disrespectful to passengers\/customers,
How does the TTC get congestion on its tracks? A mystery train showed up unexpectedly? @TTChelps #TTC,
RT @CBCNews: TTC bus driver charged in Amaria Diljohn\u2019s death http:\/\/t.co\/BAppbqUMn8 http:\/\/t.co\/RRmy3i0x7f,
RT @shexDread: Like.. The Finch bus is already late. 3 came at once and they're all \just chilling\" before they pick us up? Smh.. Do better\u2026",
