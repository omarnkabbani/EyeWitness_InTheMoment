@calgarytransit there's some high person on train #2447 who was kicking the doors and is creating a potential dangerous situation for the passengers.
@calgarytransit I just saw some transit employees walking out of Rundle station. They didn't have any personal protective equipment. It makes me wonder, is CT providing staff with PPE gear and &amp;  hand sanitizers now? Hope so.
Hey @calgarytransit, just watched bus #6055 run a SOLID red light southbound 52nd and McKenzie Towne link. If I'd have stepped off of the curb I'd have been hit. Not ok!!
@calgarytransit the passenger that I just tweeted you about on car #2422 got off at Crowfoot.
@calgarytransit The gentleman did get off at the next stop (Crowfoot). I was just worried about your driver, but he did step down &amp; walked away. Thank you very much.  Have a great day.

@calgarytransit the chinook/heritage c-train replacement bus I am on (ID 6008) may have actually been soiled with human faeces, but the smell is bad enough that nobody seems to want to actively look for it. Someone has notified the driver, but I think it needs to be inspected.

@calgarytransit Just got on the 44. Bus 1258. I get hes doing his job but asking me where I am going is wrong. If transit wants to enforce payment have someone at each station asking.

@calgarytransit Do your operators understand this at all ?  I just had the driver of rt 9 bus 8333 tell me to scan my ticket on the reader to pay my fare.  I double checked after getting to my destination.  There is nothing for me to scan. If the operators are misinforming people, things are
