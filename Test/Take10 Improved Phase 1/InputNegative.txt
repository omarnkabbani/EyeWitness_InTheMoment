very understandable sorry for the wait please let customer relations know what happened today la
translink is making a small fortune off of the faresaver shortage they have created here s my solution n yvr
wce riders get 40 90 min delay and translink does not hold community shuttle buses so rural riders get delayed even more
september monthly pass paper
wce riders pay highest fares and translink does not help us when there are train delays buses leave empty amp we walk or wait
wce serves rural areas translink should hold buses or add more when there s long train delays we shouldnt have 2 pay 4 cabs
you can suggest that through customer relations via as all suggestions are appreciated la

probably shouldn t say most nights if it s going to be everyday from the 9th til the 13th thanks i guess
you guys seriously have a loud as hell track grinder running when people are trying to sleep what s wrong with you
had a thought the other day why don t you video the buskers on the seabus walkway van side for twitter clips many work hrs
pc radio premium android
806
many of the buskers are so talented but get no other recognition by translink the other day new busker sang as if in a musical
listening to this wonderful singer he sounded as if he was in les miserable or miss saigon any idea who he is
okay thanks have a safe journey home now and sleep well
thank you for responding well it does show but if its the origin point it won t make much sense there was a huge line up
i lt 3 transit the better it gets the happier i d be ncertain circumstances r unavoidable bt its b8r kp ur riders well informed

sometimes things can not be unseen playfully quirky or disaster you decide on station typeface
i u2019m glad i have a monthly pass so i don u2019t really need to tap
ugh so sick of and their horseshit system of doing stuff any1 noe where to get a bus pass frustrated vancouverproblems
so starting oct5 i tap in for the bus and then in again plus out on the train also can i tap for a friend to pay for them
hey it sure is getting difficult to pay for transit only one machine working at commercial drive stn
i was out in the open as in urban areas so u2026 it s ok i m home now lt 3
i only need store value 160 is all 1 zone starting oct 5 right
translink line up compass card kiosk at stadium stn due to confusion over card implementation it is not oct 1 cbc ht u2026
thanks 4 retailers and none i think i m done they are coming back right pretty sure none on the north shore
translink says customers will be able to convert faresaver tickets etc into compass card credit
dennisshurd we do much more than check fares amp we will still need to check compass cards
translink says it will start closing some fare gates on skytrain 250k passengers now have a compass card
it s time to get a compass card from the only place hat sells them and closes at 430 wtf
and with no fare cards what do we do until then poorplanning
and with no fare cards what do we do until then poorplanning
maybe time provide a big compass update confusion re fare savers not avail gates part closed new amp old machines working
if everyone has to have one why limit daily sales especially to a number that will half fill a train
translink so i can t buy farebooks anymore and only 200 people a day can buy compass cards but i m sure you ll be ticketing farehopers
there was a highly confrontational male threatening another passenger he exited at edmonds red hoodie sports bag sunglasses
where is the 335 heading to surrey central from gateway it s been a solid 20 minutes i ve been waiting for it
hey vancouver seriously this is actually a thing
from guildford
but for the next month 200 day and no retailer has farebooks anymore this company is a joke an absolute joke
so there s 6 000 available for sale until november 1 what s your daily average ridership
yeah i got texted when it was going to come after i got on it thanks
only one of four ticket dispensers works at waterfront station no wonder people cheat
at stop 55656 where is 324 seriously
when i tried to text a bus stop number it won t text me back for some reason _
i think your 106 drivers need a compass three buses to metrotown none to new west from edmonds conspiracy
you can already load monthly passes at the stadium customer service centre possibly also at the cvms in stations
faqs i take a skytrain and then a bus will i be charged for the skytrain and the bus separately
tried to buy a monthly compass card but couldn t find an option on the machine is that option not available yet
how i don t see that option just wce passes
thanks that is apparent pls get proactive and explain what is isn t avail which system to use etc via news media
conspiracy
if i take the 555 from la glory to burnanby can i use a 1 zone mo pass starting oct 5
oh now it shows up 5 minutes later i texted 56884 and my provider is chatr
i was at a compass machine at waterfront
when is the 301 going to get to 52081 the 6 08 pm bus never came
any idea for when the 430 to metrotown is going to show up to no 4 road was scheduled for 6 22
and what if did that trip all the way to vancouver 555 gt skytrain would a 2 zone mo pass work
okay i ll try again thank you for your speedy reply
can you dm me my ticket number i m trying to get insurance and need to pay it off but the offices are closed
i have a compass card with an october 1 zone pass loaded would i be able to use it to get home at 12 45am later
the 6 41 26 bus hasn t shown up yet at stop 51639 at joyce station is it late or not coming at all
followed map and visited 16 retailers gt 10km walk there are no 1z faresaver 7 11 said no more ever
sign at 7 11 dunsmuir seymour same msg at 16 other retailers some have 2z faresavers but now worthless
why come translink not working
why come translink not working today
are the 178 or c28 going to show to pick up us up after getting off the west coast express
unbelievable scrounging bus fare so can get to event tomorrow and be responsible nothing like organization
port moody station 61912
yes what about the c28 you got ta communicate don t you work with the wce make an announcement or something
you missed my point i can t buy 1z anywhere 2z is avail but should now be priced same as 1z why buy 2z when all points r1z
ok will try that later thanks
will this affect the vcc line going from lougheed to new west

translink remember how funny it was when bus 33 never showed up no oh you had to be there to get it i guess iwasthere5minsearly
still doesn t explain why the bus driver didn t stop for us the bus wasn t full and he just drove right on by
all i wanted to know was why everyone on the bus was charged more than translink website states their response was unhelpful
55329 said the bus was supposed to come a few minutes ago but was shown as cancelled
why did your c21 yaletown just skip me at 59395 he drove past the stop and the bus was empty and it s freezing
the driver looked at me and the bus was empty too with almost no people in the bus not impressed with garbage workers
your 403 north this morning at 10 30ish skipped a bunch of us while the bus was near empty at a bus stop near jones road
no the bus was relatively empty there was maybe 10 people seated
no the bus was full because of the cancelation
no no good bus driver please enjoy your newspaper it s not like the bus was supposed to leave 10min ago translink
any reason why the 9 30 c15 did not stop to pick people up at the apex ave stop the bus was not full
the bus was completely empty it was the 345 leaving from stop 51939 at king george he she just passed by the line and left
