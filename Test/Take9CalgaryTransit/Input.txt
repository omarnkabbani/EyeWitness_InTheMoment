hey how can i report an incident i witnessed on a bus today
quick question i know the low income bus pass timeframe has been extended but what will happen once its over will the time be extended again or no
ctriders summer in upon us please remember to walk your bikes through the ctrain station amp on the ctrain platform al
i know this is a difficult time but the pm 148 schedule needs to be fixed there s random buses added to the schedule such as the 16 25 to chinook that don t show up at all then there s 45 minute gaps in service
route 23 bus 6055
this is the bus i m on right now it s number 1 overfilled when you cut back the number of busses and trains you put both passengers and drivers in danger
thank you a bus every half hour is all i ask cause thats what i thought its supposed to be
today i got to the stop at 16 15 previously i d gone out for the 15 56 and it never showed today the 16 31 showed up right on time but there was no 16 25 bus as well when i turned on real time on the app this is what happened
ctriders from may 2 4 the blueline will be closed between marlborough and city hall stations shuttle buses will be
hey how bout you keep trains clean and on time and don t tell us what to do thanks
hay can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
thanks for the change of bus 23 sundridage near canada post as yiur app says us will be here doesn t show now 23 more minutes to wait
i am essentially talking about all bus routes that said i have been frustrated by the 10 the 22 66 13 what was the 73 20 one that goes to mckenzie town centre and more
i have done so many times on multiple occasions i have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min s more than that like every 1 2 hour is not acceptable thank you
pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car
true however more bus drivers more tax payers amp employed people and may also mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads assuming less car drivers
the buses don t always or often coordinate well with each other aside from that why should i spend a life time waiting around when i have a million of other things that i could be doing that would help me get more done in my day
even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary
so for it to be more convenient for you because you can t time bus routes properly you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes good thing you re not in charge
for a 6 30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and i can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus
great job letting homeless people take garbage bag of cans on buses now driver didn t day a word even when three passengers had to move because that bag smelled so aweful
ctriders we are sanitizing ctrain cars and stations on the go our cleaning crews are in safety vests have badges and
before i answer that is it policy for calgary transit to allow people to bring garbage bags on to buses if theres ever a concern whether its cans that rattle or people s property maybe drivers could do something
calgary transit says it has been busy cleaning inside its buses and c trains
in ednonton transit driver dont allow garbage bags on buses never seen a garbage bag on a bus until this whole ride for free started yeah i m paying but i sure see alot of bums not and getting to ride everywhere
no one said anything in particular to the driver however the old lady that was telling be ayse that guy put his bag in between her and the person with the bag screamed loud enough the driver had to of heard her everyone else did
route 6 time was when i sent you tweet this isn t about myself alerting the driver this needs to be delt with before anyone with a garbage bags gets on a bus thanks
well than it seems your quite alright with bums getting on to buses with stinky garbage bags full of cans i cant think of any other transit system allowing this but you do you dont need any more info if that s your policy take care
thank you for keeping buses and trains going
thank you for bus drivers and staffs who clean up the bus at night time how can i go to work daily without their help
i will keep on buying monthly bus pass please do not stop your services
did you guys pull an update for your android app cause its crashing as soon as i open it please fix this i need the app for work since your bus times are all over the place now
maybe you should have the police start watching 39 st station i m tired of watching junkies and drug addicts at this stop and usually all the way south i will not be getting a pass next month i ve seen meth crack pipes people with needles just this week
every single day 39 st is a disaster the train is basically a meth lab on wheels right now morning and afternoon no thanks deal with it
didn t know i couldn t pay for the bus with cash right now but shout out to the driver who let me on anyways because of you i was able to get my medications
hi my neighbor is doing reno s in his house which isnt the problem the issues is stupid company driver s parking in this bus stop everytime
furthermore i want to waste as few days of my short mortal life being stuck being bored and sometimes in pain because it is so cold waiting for buses every 1 2 hour service during normal times sucks
shuttle buses are 24 to 27 feet in length the suggested distancing is 6 feet between two people but the shuttle buses have 10 passengers seating limit in covid 19 please explain so that i feel safe using transit
i do not want to be punished for making the environmentally responsible decision of not driving and taking a bus instead
i just wished as an essential worker we could get a discount on monthly bus passes like the low income don t have to get one until may
do i need buy a low income bus pass for next month
i think they are smoking something on the train the number is 2419 we are heading towards marlborough
didn t get bus number but want to say the driver of the 38 leaving whitehorn station 6096 at 7 09 pm did a good job picking up the transfers means a lot when you ve been up 16 hours
oi one of your busses just drove by me and didnt stop i was standing in the light so he could see me and he passed right by it was the 20 heritage on 72nd bus stop number 5737 what kind of service is going on now i m late for work
why don t you put more officers in the trains it s getting worse as the days go by scary i won t take the train anymore ever

southbound shawnessy station this morning
i use it every morning to get to work i take route 7 from marda loop downtown today the 6 am bus never came and the ct ap was not working properly ended up taking a cab
it is better for a bus to be 1 or 2 min s late than leave 2 min s early particularly during these times
took a bus today to work frontline chi chi and i m so happy with the way social distancing is being enforced it s a must fightcovid19
there s no way the buses are being regularly sanitized so to be quite honest with you i have not ridden transit in over a month
when will be able to get the monthly bus pass is there a way to get them by mail
yes i need to get my low income monthly bus pass

when are busses getting gps trackers so i can see on transit app if bus is ahead or behind schedule
yes the amount of times i ve wished there was somewhere to pee while on the train is ridiculous
is there a problem on the red line right now at southland station and the times for the next train keep going up
i think it s a bit more than that i ve been here almost half an hour according to the app a ghost train came through at 9 15 but nothing thanks for checking though
ctriders from may 2 4 the blueline will be closed between marlborough and city hall stations shuttle buses will be
it would be nice for the peace officers to walk through the trains saying hello and actually engaging with passengers
just an observation from using transit daily red line pre covid days
just saw about a dozen calgary transit workers near the ne bus barn walking together without social distancing nice example fellas
why do people have such an interest in all of your drivers it s almost obsessive the way they watch them they may be in a bus together they may live together
